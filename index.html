                    Hi there, my name is Torbjørn. I’m a 25 year old Norwegian who has been studying front-end development since
                    the summer of 2020.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content__bodytext">
                    Before this began I worked at the operations department of Bergen’s port authority, and more recently I worked
                    as a store employee at an electronics store, which is where I discovered how much I enjoy working with
                    anything related to IT, despite never considering myself a very technical person.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content__bodytext">
                    A friend I hadn’t met in years had recently completed his studies in front-end development and, as I’d never
                    heard much about it before, I was intrigued. He explained that it’s a growing field with plenty of job
                    opportunities, and went into detail about what his job involved.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content__bodytext">
                    I immediately thought this could be something for me. So I looked into it further, and shortly afterwards I’d
                    applied to study front-end development at Noroff Vocational School in Bergen.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content__bodytext">
                    I didn’t know much about web-development beforehand, but I was more motivated than I’d ever been in my life. I
                    wanted to make this work. So I put in the hours and made no compromises with myself. I didn't have to force
                    myself for long though, as I soon found out I really enjoy doing this. So much that I even started exploring
                    and experimenting with subjects outside of our curriculum in my spare time.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content__bodytext">
                    Thanks to this mindset, I was able to learn more in this one year than any year before, and while my journey
                    in web-development may have only just begun, I’m just as passionate as ever and I’m aiming to learn even more
                    in the years to come.

                Hi there, my name is Torbjørn. I’m 25 years old and I’ve been studying front-end development in Bergen for the
                past year.
              </p>
              <p class="content__bodytext">
                Before this began I worked several part-time jobs. I was previously employed at the operations department of
                Bergen’s port authority, and more recently I worked as a store employee at Clas Ohlson, which is where I
                discovered how much I enjoy working with anything related to IT.
              </p>
              <p class="content__bodytext">
                A friend I hadn’t met in years had recently finished his studies in front-end development and as I’d never heard
                much about it before, I was intrigued. He explained that it’s a growing field with plenty of job opportunities,
                and went into detail about what his job involved.
              </p>
              <p class="content__bodytext">
                I immediately thought this could be something for me. So I looked into it further, and shortly afterwards I’d
                applied to study front-end development at Noroff Vocational School in Bergen.
              </p>
              <p class="content__bodytext">
                I didn’t know much about web-development beforehand, but I was more motivated than I’d ever been in my life. I
                wanted to make this work. So I put in the hours and made no compromises with myself. I always strived to go one
                step further, and to explore concepts beyond the curriculum. After all, as front-end technologies are in constant
                evolution, it’s unreasonable to expect any classes on the subject to cover everything there is to know.
              </p>
              <p class="content__bodytext">
                Thanks to this mindset, I was able to learn more in this one year than any year before, and while my journey in
                web-development may have only just begun, I’m just as passionate as ever and I’m aiming to learn even more in the
                year to come.
